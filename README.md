Overview of the Project

Project:UART (UNIVERSAL ASYNCHRONOUS RECEIVER-TRANSMITTER) DESIGN

Objective

Communication Interface: Establish serial communication between two or more devices using the UART protocol.
Data Transmission: Transmit and receive data reliably over a serial link.
Error Handling: Implement error detection mechanisms, such as parity bits.

Key Activies

UART Module: A microcontroller or any other device with built-in UART hardware.
Transmitter (TX): Sends data serially one bit at a time.
Receiver (RX): Receives serial data and converts it back to parallel form.
Baud Rate: The speed of communication, typically in bits per second (bps).
Parity Bit: Optional error-checking bit added to the data frame.
Stop Bits: Indicates the end of a data packet.

Technologies Used
